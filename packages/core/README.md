# @aegis/core

`@aegis/core` contains application-independent foundations shared by real AegisAI consumer projects. It is private and source-linked inside this monorepo; it is not currently published to npm.

## What belongs here

- Generic configuration contracts
- Validated HTTP/HTTPS URL parsing
- Functions that accept consumer-provided defaults and environment sources
- Reusable deterministic utilities with at least one real consumer
- Named package exports that do not depend on a specific application

## What does not belong here

- Application URLs or environment names
- Page selectors, page objects, components, flows, fixtures, or business rules
- Product names, catalogue assumptions, or requirement documents
- Application Docker infrastructure
- Speculative abstractions created only for possible future use
- AI or LLM execution inside deterministic test paths

Dependency direction is always from a consumer to `@aegis/core`. Core must never import consumer code.

A future monetary utility may belong here only when it supports explicit locale and currency configuration and has a real consumer. A consumer-specific currency parser should remain with that consumer until then.
